# Debian-Web-Server
A basic Linux (tested on Debian) web server written in C/C++, accepts GET requests and returns webpages/images, proof of concept for support for dynamically generated content using Lua. 

Should return all static webpages, dynamic content is proof of concept and currently only returns the two pieces of data such as in nameage.html or a similar page.
